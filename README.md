## Graph-Isomorphism

2-1, CS-F222, Discrete Structures for CS Assignment. We have to report if two ```undirected graphs``` are ```isomorphic``` or not.

## Part A

> Output the degree sequence of the graph.
> The ```degree sequence``` is obtained by determining the degrees of each node in the graph and arranging it as a sequence in non-increasing order.

### Input
> The first line of the input would be an integer n - the number of nodes.
> Second line of the input would be an integer e - the number of edges The next e lines contain a pair x and y ( 1≤ x,y ≤ n and x ≠ y) , to indicate that
> there is an edge between nodes numbered x and y.

### Output
> Output the degree sequence in non-increasing order. Output should be printed in standard output.


## Installation

```bash
gcc Main.c
./a.out ./Test/a.txt
```
``` It will create output.txt file in Test directory```
